## Repository Information
This repository is not used as a backup and is intended as a showcase only. There are several key files removed, particularly those pertaining to database connections and security information. The files here are divided into 3 key directories:

1. The src directory contains all kotlin and java files.
2. The layout directory contains all of the xml files.
3. The GreyMattersLogos directory contains the logos used in the GreyMattersApp eventlist as well as images for current news.

I was the sole developer on this project and wrote all code contained in these files. I have designed half the logos contained in the GreyMattersLogos directory while the remaining logos belong to groups under GreyMattersActiveAgeing or their respective sources.
